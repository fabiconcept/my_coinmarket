# Coinmarket Clone

## StoryBoard


I'm building a coinmarket_cap clone or my personal Project.

I chose this project specifically because of the challenges i faced while building the weather app (another personal), I had issues with handling to promise from the api request response. So far i've really grasp the concept and application of most issues i aimed to tackle in this project.

i hope i encounter 1000 bugs 🐞🐞
